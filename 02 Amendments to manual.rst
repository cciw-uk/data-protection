Amendments to CCiW manual
=========================

We need a short section that notes CCiW's responsibilities to handle data
carefully, with a very brief summary of the main points. Very rough first draft
as follows:

----


Data protection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an organisation it is important to respect the data protection rights of
everyone involved in camp, including and officers. This is part of our duty of
love to our neighbours, and we have specific legal obligations too, as set out
in the GDPR and other data protection laws, which we must abide by.

In summary, in terms of the application of these laws to our activities, the
main responsibilities we need to be aware of are as follows:

* We should collect only the personal data that we need to do our job, and keep
  it only as long as we need to.

* We must use this data only for the agreed purposes for which we've collected
  it.

* We should not pass the data on to third parties, or allow non-authorised
  people to access it.

* We must take particular care with certain more sensitive data, such as
  information about past criminal records that are part of the officer
  application process.

* We must report data breaches to ICO and the "data subjects" (the people the
  information is about) in certain circumstances.

In all of these things, we need to take into account our other responsibilities,
and ensure the primacy of the well-being of campers that we look after.

The trustees have the responsibility to ensure our practices and policies are in
line with data protection law, and there are specific duties that fall to
different members of CCiW, which are detailed in other places:

* Web master/web developers: see the "Security and data protection" manual that
  is in the CCiW source code:
  https://gitlab.com/cciw/cciw.co.uk/-/blob/master/docs/security.rst

* Leaders: STATUS:TODO

* Booking secretary: STATUS:TODO

* DBS Officer: STATUS:WIP

The trustees will be responsible for answering any queries regarding use of
personal data not covered in these manuals, and they will use resources
including the following to adjust our policies as needed in the future:

* https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/in-your-sector/charity/charities-faqs/

* https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/

We will need a new section about CCiW Chairperson and CPO's responsibilities as
follows:

----

DBS responsibilities for Chairperson and CPO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a DBS check reveals a criminal record, in most cases the DBS Officer will
contact the Chairperson and CPO for a decision regarding the officer's
suitability for camp. In this case, the Chairperson and CPO must do the
following:

* Come to a decision about whether the officer should be accepted on camp or
  not. They may choose to contact the officer in order to come to their
  decision.

* If the decision is to refuse the officer, they must communicate this to the
  camp leader, but normally without disclosing details of the criminal
  convictions they have learned about. It will be the camp leader's
  responsibility to tell the officer.

* If the decision is to accept the officer, they may feel it is appropriate to
  pass on to the camp leader some information regarding the conviction, if this
  will help protect campers, officers and leaders on the camp.

* They must fill in a document using the template provided on Google Drive. This
  document should have its permissions set so that it is accessible by the
  'Committee' group.

  If the decision is a "No", normally it will be sufficient to record this fact.
  Since the officer will not be coming on camp, further details are not
  necessary, and we don't want to be storing more details than necessary. The
  purpose here is primarily to be able to demonstrate that we are checking DBS
  results.

  If the decision is a "Yes", normally more detail will be needed. The primary
  audience of this information is people who in the future may want to know the
  reasons why we accepted the officer. In particular, if in the future an
  allegation is made concerning this officer, the information in this document
  may be relevant to law enforcement, and we want to be able to cooperate with
  them as fully as possible, and also to be able to demonstrate the carefulness
  with which we have acted.

  It is intended that the information here will be kept indefinitely.

----

The template should look like the following:

----


DBS Decision
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
Date:
Officer:
Name of Chairperson and CPO Officer, and any others making the decision:

Decision: accept/reject?

Reasons (if accepting):


How much (if any) of the information about a criminal conviction was disclosed to
camp leaders, and why?
