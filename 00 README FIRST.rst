GDPR work overview and approach
-------------------------------

This page is an overview of all the work I've done to ensure that we are in line
with GDPR/data protection laws.


The deliverables I'm including are:

* `Decisions and actions document <Decisions%20and%20actions%20document.rst>`_

  A document detailing my recommendations about our data protection policies,
  including actions already taken, along with my reasons for everything. It
  should be read by the committee, and kept for later reference (especially as
  evidence of our due diligence regarding GDPR), but doesn't need to be read by
  leaders or become part of our manuals.

  It's a very long document, sorry! But I've tried to keep it fairly readable.

  I'm anticipating that there will be lots of places you want to amend things,
  feel free to change the document into any format that suits you to do this.
  Google Docs might work well (my internet connection was too bad for this
  when drafting it).

* `Amendments to manual <Amendments%20to%20manual.rst>`_

* CCiW website security docs

  This is part of the CCiW source code repo. The link is:
  https://gitlab.com/cciw/cciw.co.uk/-/blob/master/docs/security.rst

  This includes information about security, privacy, data protection and data
  retention. As a lot of the GDPR responsibilities fall on the web master, this
  contains the longest section explicitly on data protection principles.

  Note:

  * it is part of the source code/documentation that the web developers read
  * it is therefore public, as all our source code is.
  * the audience is the web master/developers.

* `DBS Officer Manual <DBS%20Officer%20Manual.rst>`_

  Once accepted, this document should be reformatted (I can do this) and added
  to the "CCiW Handbook" documents.

* `Booking Secretary Manual <Booking%20Secretary%20Manual.rst>`_

  ``STATUS:TODO`` - I haven't been able to do this yet!

  Once accepted, this document should be reformatted (I can do this) and added
  to the "CCiW Handbook" documents.

* CCiW Website access information

  The link is:
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Ox8wWfqA73vqN66yEQRSASuKxtrFkcftJa5oFytiPc/edit

  This document is distinct from the previous one to allow it to include private
  information that shouldn't be a part of our public source code.

  It should be visible only to committee members, let me know if you can't
  access it. The document has been around a while but has been updated and
  completed as part of this work.

* Data retention policy

  This is part of the CCiW source code repo. The link is:
  https://gitlab.com/cciw/cciw.co.uk/-/blob/master/config/data_retention.yaml

* Appropriate Policy Document

  ``STATUS:TODO``

* Privacy notice

  ``STATUS:TODO``


For external documents I'll include a snapshot of the most recent version when
submitting this work to the committee.
