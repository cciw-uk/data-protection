GDPR work overview and approach
-------------------------------

This page is an overview of all the work I've done to ensure that we are in line
with GDPR/data protection laws.


The deliverables I'm including are:

* 01 GDPR decisions and actions document.

  A document detailing my recommendations about our data protection policies,
  including actions already taken, along with my reasons for everything. It
  should be read by the committee, and kept for later reference (especially as
  evidence of our due diligence regarding GDPR), but doesn't need to be read by
  leaders or become part of our manuals.

  It's a long document, but I've tried to keep it fairly readable.

* 01 Proposed amendments to CCiW handbook

  The main changes are:

   * additions to leader responsibilities
   * a short section on data protection which references other parts and docs.

* 03 CCiW Website security procedures

  The link is:
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Ox8wWfqA73vqN66yEQRSASuKxtrFkcftJa5oFytiPc/edit

  This should be visible only to committee members, let me know if you can't access it.
  A copy of the most recent version is included. The document has been around a while but
  has been updated and completed as part of this work.

* 04 CCiW website security docs

  The links is:
  https://gitlab.com/cciw/cciw.co.uk/-/blob/master/docs/security.rst

  This document is distinct from the previous item:
  * it is part of the source code that the developers read
  * it is therefore public
  * the audience is the web master/developers.

  A copy of the most recent version is included.

  TODO add a significant data protection section to this.

* 05 Data retention policy

* 06 Privacy notice



Relative to other documents circulated:

* "CCiW Data Protection Policy"

  I'm suggesting that we use extremely little of this, for reasons described above.
  The equivalent to most of its contents is my "decisions document".

  Many of the things in the document are entirely impractical for us, and would
  simply never be actioned e.g.:

    39.5 A list (appendix 1) will be kept of locations where data is stored by
    the CCiW. This will include CCiW hardware and devices, third-party servers,
    mobile devices, computers and devices owned by volunteers and/or contractors
    used in accordance with the WOYD policy and physical records.

  Are we actually going to keep a list of the location of every personal device
  of CCiW leaders? And what about online services - in general the nature of
  "cloud" computing is that you don't know the location of the computing device.
  And what would this list actually achieve?

* "Work on Your Own Device" document.

  I'm suggesting we don't have this, because no-one will read it or apply it.
  Also it kind of gets it backwards - there are no "CCiW devices", and we need
  to account for that. Instead, we start with processes that protect people from
  needing to worry about data on their own device, and where this can't be
  avoided, we prompt people about the need to handle data correctly on their
  device.
