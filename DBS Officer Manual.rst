DBS Officer Manual
==================

The document describes the responsibilities and main tasks of the DBS Officer(s)
in CCiW. DBS stands for Dislosure and Barring Service - the UK government
service for checking a person's criminal record.

Any significant changes to this document need approval by the CCiW Committee.

Responsibilities
----------------

As a DBS Officer, you are responsible for:

* Checking that officers who come on camp have had a DBS check done recently (in
  the past 3 years).

* Contacting officers to get details of DBS results where they already exist.

* Getting new DBS checks done where necessary, usually with the help of an
  external organisation, and obtaining a copy for CCiW to check.

* Liaising with the CCiW chair person and CPO regarding any DBS results that
  might impinge on an officer's suitability for coming on camp.

* Liaising with the CCiW webmaster regarding:
  * any temporary changes to the processes that have been used for some reason.
  * any permanent changes to the processes that are needed or would be helpful.

* If there is more than one officer, liaising with each other to ensure
  work is divided up appropriately and completed.

* Ensuring that all work is done in a way to respect the privacy of officers in
  compliance with relevant laws.

About DBS checks
----------------

A DBS check is a certificate from the UK Disclosure and Barring Service that has
details of criminal records. The DBS Officer needs to see this or a photograph
of it to check an officers suitability for camp.

There is an "enhanced" form of a DBS certificate that is part of the DBS update
system. For these certificates, instead of the full application system, you can
do an online check to see if there have been any changes since the certificate
was issued. We make use of this process, as long as we have seen the original
certificate as well (since the update service only indicates changes since the
issuing of the certificate).

DBS Officer checking process
----------------------------

CCiW's policy is that all officers (including leaders) who come on camp must
have had a recent DBS check done, where 'recent' for us mean in the previous 3
years.

Officers who come on camp fill out an application form in which they provide
most of the details needed. They are asked for:

1. A current "enhanced DBS number with update service" - only if they consent to
   us using it.
2. A consent tick box for us obtaining a DBS check.

This provides all the consent we need to proceed with checks and pass on
information as required. If the officer answers 'No' to question 2, this is
flagged up later on the "Manage DBS" screen, and will block the officer from
coming on camp.

The DBS Officer's job starts by logging on to the CCiW website:

  https://www.cciw.co.uk/officers/

You then use the links provided to navigate to the 'Manage DBS' page. The page
lists all the officers who have been added to camp officer lists, with their
status, which can be:

1. “Needs application form” - it is the responsibility of the camp leader to chase
   this officer up.

2. “Recent” - we have done a recent check of this officer and affirmed
   suitability. No action required.

3. “Never” - we have not yet done any DBS checks for this officer.

4. “Out of date” - we have done a DBS check, but not one that counts as recent.

For 3 and 4, the DBS Officer needs to take action to obtain a DBS check.

If we have no details of previous DBS checks, you should first email
the officer to see if there is a recent DBS check from another organisation that
can be used. If there is not, and a new DBS check is needed, you should:

* Send an email to our "checking organisation" asking for a DBS form
  using the "Ask <CHECKING ORG> to send DBS form..." button **OR**

* If we are sending DBS forms ourselves, send the DBS form in the post
  and register this on the website using "Mark DBS form sent".

Once a DBS check is complete, the results are sent back to the officer (not
CCiW). You should then communicate with the officer and arrange to see a copy,
usually by a photograph sent over email. This will apply for all new DBS checks
that CCiW organise, and for DBS checks done for another organisation that we
have not yet seen.

For the situation where the officer has a DBS check registered with the online
update system provided by the UK government, instead of getting a new DBS check
done, you should use the update system to check if there have been any
additions.

Having obtained the DBS results (whether a copy of the initial certificate, or
updates via the update service), you must must make a decision about the
contents.

If there are any items in the results that could affect the suitability of the
applicant to be an officer on camp, you must talk to the CCiW Chairperson and
the CCiW Child Protection Officer, preferably by phone. It will be the
responsibility of those people, not yours, to record the details of the decision
made, if appropriate (see committee's manual).

(**QUESTION** - do the CCiW committee have guidance regarding the types of
criminal convictions that need checking with them? I presume almost any
conviction that a DBS would list would need checking with the committee? As I
understand it, minor traffic offences won't show in a DBS, but major ones would,
like drink driving, and I presume we would care about that.)

You should then record the details of the DBS certificate on the CCiW website,
including the following information:

* Disclosure number
* Check type ("full form" or "online check")
* Date of issue/check
* Requested by (CCiW or name of other organisation),
* Applicant accepted (yes/no)
* DBS registered with update service (yes/no)

Handling sensitive data
-----------------------

Some parts of this process currently involve sending emails from a personal
address, or other communication using digital devices or in the post. Since we
are handling sensitive personal information (addresses and information about
criminal records), you must be careful to observe the following points:

* Choose long, secure passwords for accessing the CCiW website and other online
  services you use.

* Take appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that other people who
  might have access to your computer/device do not use your CCiW account, asking
  the CCiW webmaster for help as needed.

* Once emails/files/photographs are no longer needed, they must be deleted. This
  includes any received emails that contain officer information, and any copies
  of sent emails (in your "Outbox" or "Sent mail").

* Paper notes or additional computer files may be used to help organise your
  work. However, where the notes contain sensitive information (officer
  addresses or details about criminal records):

  * You should take care to ensure that no one else accesses this information.

  * You should destroy the paper/computer files (or remove the sensitive
    information) once it is no longer needed for the purpose of checking the
    DBS, and must not be kept permanently anywhere outside official CCiW filing
    systems and databases.

* You should liaise with the CCiW webmaster to improve processes so that as far
  as possible they do not need to store sensitive information.

* No information about the contents of CRB results should be communicated to
  other people not mentioned in this manual, except where required by law.

Data breaches
-------------

A data breach is when personal information is given to someone or is accessed by
someone that we did not have the right to share the information with. Regarding
DBS information, this includes other CCiW officers or 3rd parties.

For a DBS Officer, a breach could occur if, for example, someone else accessed
the information on a computer or phone, or if information was mistakenly
forwarded to the wrong person.

In the event of a data breach, you must:

* attempt to contain the breach if possible - for example, by contacting the
  person to whom the information was wrongly passed on and asking them to erase
  it and not pass it on further.

* inform the CCiW webmaster and the CCiW chairperson about the breach as soon as
  you can, who will together decide if further action needs to be taken.

Fallbacks
---------

In the case of website functionality not being available or not working
sufficiently well, it's important that DBS checking continues, and the DBS
Officers should use fallback mechanisms to do manually what is automated by the
website.

The following points should be observed:

* You should alert the CCiW web master to the problem so that it can be fixed,
  and so that the security of any fallback mechanisms can be assessed.

* You may fall back to using manual emails in the place of automated ones, using
  you own email address, providing the points about handling sensitive data
  (above) are observed.
