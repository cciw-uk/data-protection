Amendments to CCiW manual
=========================

There are various places in existing manual/handbooks that we should update.

We need a short section that notes CCiW's responsibilities to handle data
carefully, with a very brief summary of the main points. This could potentially
be a new document. The intended audience is the CCiW trustees.
Draft as follows:

----


Data protection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an organisation it is important to respect the data protection rights of
everyone involved in camp, including campers and officers. This is part of our
duty of love to our neighbours, and we have specific legal obligations as well,
as set out in the GDPR and other data protection laws, which we must abide by.

In summary, in terms of the application of these laws to our activities, the
main responsibilities we need to be aware of are as follows:

* We should collect only the personal data that we need to do our job, and keep
  it only as long as we need to.

* To describe "doing our job" more specifically and technically, we must have a
  `lawful basis <https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/>`_ for any "processing" of
  personal data (which means doing anything with data, including storing). For
  our purposes, the main ones are:

  - contractual obligation (covers ways in which we must use campers data
    because we have agreed to provide certain services to them)
  - legal obligation (covers ways we must use camper and officers data
    as part of legal duties to look after campers etc.)
  - legitimate interest (covers some business interests like the right to
    pursue payment and to advertise to people who came on camp previously)
  - consent (we've specifically asked them if we can use data in a certain way)
  - vital interest (protecting someone's life - this reason can be used
    as a last resort)

* We must keep and use this data only for the agreed purposes for which we've
  collected it (as set out in detail in the ROPA **TODO**).

* We should not pass the data on to third parties, or allow non-authorised
  people to access it.

* We must take particular care with certain more sensitive data, such as
  information about past criminal records that are part of the officer
  application process.

* We must respect a set of rights of the "data subjects" (the people the
  information is about), including the right to access the information and the
  right to erasure.

* We must report data breaches to ICO and the data subjects in certain
  circumstances.

In all of these things, we need to take into account our other responsibilities,
and ensure the primacy of the well-being of campers that we look after.

The trustees have the responsibility to ensure our practices and policies are in
line with the good of our campers and officers, and data protection law. A
helpful GDPR checklist that the trustees should read is found in the ICO
document `Data Protection by design and default
<https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-by-design-and-default/>`_.

There are specific duties that fall to different members of CCiW, which are
detailed in other places:

* Web master/web developers: see the "Security and data protection" manual that
  is in the CCiW source code:
  https://gitlab.com/cciw/cciw.co.uk/-/blob/master/docs/security.rst

* Leaders: "Guidance for Leaders and Chaplains"

* Booking secretary: "Booking Secretary Manual"  **TODO**

* DBS Officer: "DBS Officer Manual"

The trustees will be responsible for answering any queries regarding use of
personal data not covered in these manuals, and they will use resources
including the following to adjust our policies as needed in the future:

* https://gdpr-info.eu/

* https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/in-your-sector/charity/charities-faqs/

* https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/

Since a large part of the burden for understanding and applying GDPR falls on
the webmaster(s), the trustees should also make use of the understanding that
the webmaster(s) have on these matters and communicate with them. In particular,
the trustees must keep the webmaster informed regarding any personal information
or filing systems that are not directly under the oversight of the webmaster by
being part of the website database.

----

From what I've gathered, we do not have a documented process for what happens
when a DBS result actually shows criminal convictions, possibly because the
situation hasn't actually occurred before.

I've therefore drawn up a draft of what I thought it should be. I'm not sure
where it should live - it could be part of a document about CCiW Chairperson
and/or CPO's responsibilities.

**QUESTION** This is one of the most sensitive parts of our processes,
and should be carefully reviewed. It may help us to get some expert advice on
this. We need to carefully balance:

1. vetting officers properly
2. respecting their privacy and GDPR legislation
3. protecting ourselves regarding legal cases
4. giving both sufficient structure and flexibility to a process that is hard to
   anticipate since we have very little experience of this situation.

DBS responsibilities for Chairperson and CPO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a DBS check reveals a criminal record, in most [all?] cases the DBS Officer
will contact the Chairperson and CPO for a decision regarding the officer's
suitability for camp. In this case, the Chairperson and CPO must do the
following:

* Come to a decision about whether the officer should be accepted on camp or
  not. They may choose to contact the officer and other people in order to come
  to their decision, while taking into account the privacy rights of the
  officer.

* If the decision is to refuse the officer, they must communicate this to the
  camp leader, but normally without disclosing details of the criminal
  convictions they have learned about. It will be the camp leader's
  responsibility to tell the officer.

* If the decision is to accept the officer, they must communicate this to the
  DBS Officer. They may feel it is appropriate to pass on to the camp leader
  some information regarding the conviction, if they consider this to be
  important for ensuring the well-being of campers, officers or leaders on the
  camp.

* They must fill in a document using the template provided on Google Drive. This
  document should have its permissions set so that it is accessible only by the
  'Committee' group.

  If the decision is a "No", normally it will be sufficient to record this fact.
  Since the officer will not be coming on camp, further details are not
  necessary, and it is our policy not to store more details than necessary. The
  purpose here is primarily to be able to demonstrate that we are checking DBS
  results.

  If the decision is a "Yes", normally more detail will be needed. The primary
  audience of this information is people who in the future may want to know the
  reasons why we accepted the officer. In particular, if in the future an
  allegation is made concerning this officer, the information in this document
  may be relevant to law enforcement, and we want to be able to cooperate with
  them as fully as possible, and also to be able to demonstrate the carefulness
  with which we have acted.

  It is intended that the information here will be kept indefinitely.

----

The template mentioned above should look something like the following:

----


DBS Decision
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Date:
* Officer:
* Name of Chairperson and CPO Officer, and any others making the decision:

* Decision: accept/reject?

* Reasons (if accepting):

* How much (if any) of the information about a criminal conviction was disclosed
  to camp leaders, and why?

----

In "Guidance for Leaders and Chaplains"
---------------------------------------


In section "Leader's checklist", under "After camp", add:

    Delete all copies of downloaded camper/officer data.


In addition, I think the following new section would be helpful:

----

Data protection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Leaders have a responsibility to ensure that they protect the information about
campers and officers that CCiW has collected. This is a legal responsibility
under GDPR and other laws.

In brief, this means:

* You can and should use personal information for the purposes for which we've
  collected it, which are, broadly speaking:

  - looking after campers to the best of our ability on camp.
  - ensuing suitability of officers and training them.
  - enabling good communication between officers before, during and after camp
    regarding camp needs.

  And you may not use personal information for other purposes.

* Ensure you have campers details, including medical information, when on camp.
  Pay special attention to the instructions on the cover sheet of the downloaded
  spreadsheet of camper data.

* Don't copy sensitive officer data (like references and the statement sections
  of the application form) to your computer or print out hard

* Do not email or pass on camper booking data at all.

* You can appoint "admins" for your camp who can help with online tasks
  (like collecting references and downloading officer/camper lists). These people
  must be fully trusted - usually they will be assistant leaders - and these
  instructions must be passed on to them.

* Ensure you delete all downloaded officer/camper data by one month after the
  end of camp at the latest. You must not be store CCiW data on your devices
  long term.

* Take appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that other people who
  might have access to your computer/device do not use your CCiW account, asking
  the CCiW webmaster for help as needed.

* If you become aware of a "data breach" (data falling into the wrong hands in
  whatever way), you need to contact the CCiW webmaster and/or the trustees
  as soon as you can.

* If you think this rules need changing or clarifying, please contact the CCiW
  webmaster and/or the trustees.
